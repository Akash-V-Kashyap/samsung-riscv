# Samsung-RISCV
RISC-V is an open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) rooted in the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) design. Its open-source nature makes it freely available to anyone, enabling widespread adoption and fostering innovation in the development of custom processors tailored to specific use cases.

## Task 2
SPIKE is a simulator designed for the RISC-V architecture, enabling testing and debugging of RISC-V programs without requiring physical hardware. It emulates a RISC-V processor and cache, allowing the execution of programs or even a Linux kernel.PK (Proxy Kernel) serves as a lightweight environment to execute statically-linked RISC-V programs, functioning like a basic operating system. <br>
<br>
Perform the simulation by running a sample program (e.g., sum1ton.c) using both the gcc compiler and the RISC-V compiler. Verify that the outputs produced by both compilers are consistent when executed on the SPIKE simulator.

##
### 1. Objective
To analyze the impact of -O1 and -Ofast optimization levels on a simple C program by compiling it with RISC-V GCC, simulating it using SPIKE, and comparing the generated RISC-V object dumps with performance observations.

##
### 2. Setup
#### 1. Spike Simulator:

- Command: `spike -d pk`
- Function: Simulates the RISC-V environment in debugging mode, providing detailed execution insights.

#### 2. Optimization Levels:

- `-O1`: Balanced optimizations for performance and stability.
- `-Ofast`: Aggressive optimizations focused on speed, potentially at the expense of strict correctness.

##
### 3. Process
#### 1. Program:
A simple C program was written to add two integers and print the result.
#### C Code Used:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  	int i, sum = 0, n = 100;
  	for (i=1; i <= n; ++i) {
  	sum += i;
  	}
  	printf("Sum of numbers from 1 to %d is %d\n", n, sum);
  	return 0;
}
```

#### 2. Compilation:
- Compiler: RISC-V GCC (`riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc`)
- Optimization levels: `-O1` and `-Ofast`.
- Build Automation: A Makefile was used to streamline compilation.

#### 3. Object Dump:
- Tool: `riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump`
- Purpose: Analyze and compare machine code generated by different optimization levels.

#### 4. Simulation:
- Tool: SPIKE
- Purpose: Emulate program execution and evaluate performance across optimization levels.

##
### Insights
#### 1. Optimization Levels:
- `-O1` applies fundamental optimizations, ensuring a balance between execution speed and reliability.
- `-Ofast` leverages advanced optimizations to enhance performance, potentially trading off strict compliance.

#### 2. Simulation Benefits:
- Provides detailed execution analysis without requiring physical RISC-V hardware.
- Facilitates a deeper understanding of how optimization affects performance and code structure.

  	sum += i;
  	}
  	printf("Sum of numbers from 1 to %d is %d\n", n, sum);
  	return 0;
}
```
#### Commands:
 ```bash
  cat sum1ton.c
  gcc sum1ton.c
  ./a.out
